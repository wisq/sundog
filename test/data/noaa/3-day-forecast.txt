A. NOAA Geomagnetic Activity Observation and Forecast

The greatest observed 3 hr Kp over the past 24 hours was 4 (below NOAA
Scale levels).
The greatest expected 3 hr Kp for Sep 06-Sep 08 2017 is 7 (NOAA Scale
G3).

NOAA Kp index breakdown Sep 06-Sep 08 2017

            Sep 06     Sep 07     Sep 08
00-03UT        3          7 (G3)     4     
03-06UT        3          6 (G2)     4     
06-09UT        3          5 (G1)     4     
09-12UT        3          5 (G1)     3     
12-15UT        3          4          3     
15-18UT        6 (G2)     4          3     
18-21UT        6 (G2)     4          4     
21-00UT        7 (G3)     4          4     

Rationale: G3 (Strong) geomagnetic storm levels are likely by
mid-to-late day with the arrival of the 04 CME. G3 conditions are again
likely into day two (07 Sep) due to ongoing CME effects. Day three (08
Sep) is expected to be at mostly active levels with a chance for G1
(Minor) storm levels being reached due to the onset of a recurrent,
negative polarity CH HSS, and any residual CME effects.

B. NOAA Solar Radiation Activity Observation and Forecast

Solar radiation, as observed by NOAA GOES-13 over the past 24 hours, was
above S-scale storm level thresholds.

Solar Radiation Storm Forecast for Sep 06-Sep 08 2017

              Sep 06  Sep 07  Sep 08
S1 or greater   99%     70%     15%

Rationale: The greater than 10 MeV proton flux is expected to continue
at S2 (Moderate) levels over the next two days (06-07 Sep) with a chance
for S1 (Minor) levels on day three (08 Sep).

C. NOAA Radio Blackout Activity and Forecast

Radio blackouts reaching the R1 levels were observed over the past 24
hours. The largest was at Sep 05 2017 0108 UTC

Radio Blackout Forecast for Sep 06-Sep 08 2017

              Sep 06        Sep 07        Sep 08
R1-R2           75%           75%           75%
R3 or greater   25%           25%           25%

Rationale: Radio blackouts reaching the R1-R2 (Minor-Moderate) levels
are expected for the next three days (06-08 Sep), with a chance for R3
(Strong) radio blackouts.
