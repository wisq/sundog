Joint USAF/NOAA Solar Geophysical Activity Report and Forecast
SDF Number 248 Issued at 2200Z on 05 Sep 2017

IA.  Analysis of Solar Active Regions and Activity from 04/2100Z to
05/2100Z: Solar activity has been at high levels for the past 24 hours.
The largest solar event of the period was a M4 event observed at
05/0108Z. There are currently 6 numbered sunspot regions on the disk.
IB.  Solar Activity Forecast: Solar activity is expected to be moderate
with a chance for X-class flares on days one, two, and three (06 Sep, 07
Sep, 08 Sep).

IIA.  Geophysical Activity Summary 04/2100Z to 05/2100Z: The geomagnetic
field has been at quiet to minor storm levels for the past 24 hours.
Solar wind speed reached a peak of 629 km/s at 05/0140Z. Total IMF
reached 8 nT at 04/2145Z. The maximum southward component of Bz reached
-6 nT at 04/2207Z. Protons greater than 10 MeV at geosynchronous orbit
reached a peak level of 210 pfu at 05/1930Z. Electrons greater than 2
MeV at geosynchronous orbit reached a peak level of 3776 pfu.
IIB.  Geophysical Activity Forecast: The geomagnetic field is expected
to be at unsettled to severe storm levels on day one (06 Sep), active to
severe storm levels on day two (07 Sep) and unsettled to active levels
on day three (08 Sep). Protons are expected to cross threshold on day
one (06 Sep), are likely to cross threshold on day two (07 Sep) and have
a slight chance of crossing threshold on day three (08 Sep).
